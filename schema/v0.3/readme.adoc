TODO: define me!

== Random Thoughts to be Organized

=== Regex
Regex syntax should be compatible with all generation target language regex.

For example, if the targets for code generation are Javascript and Go, the regex
patterns should be the subset of regex syntax that is compatible with both
Javascript style regex and Go style regex.

=== Flat Tree

Unlike other API spec languages that allow arbitrary nesting of type definitions
and objects, the KAPI API definition spec aims to remain as "flat" as possible,
intentionally disallowing nested or inline definitions of types.

This requires each new type to have a dedicated declaration, name, and home and
makes life easier for those who have to read the spec as well as those writing
KAPI code generation tools.
